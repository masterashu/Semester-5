# Idea

We aim to provide an all in one marketplace for local retailers and consumers providing them the benefits of shopping. We would allow businesses to register on our platform and list their services. Consumers can order the products from our website, choosing their choice of merchant or shop. We would also allow Delivery and logistic methods to register on our site, which will allow our retail partners to choose from various delivery services, or their existing system as per their need. The users will be able to track their orders and make payment.
What we feel will separate our project from other web sites providing similar services will be two features :
 * Home pickups being one possible method of transaction, which will open up new features like pick up and delivery of laundry,door to door courier service within limited distance, car pick up and drops(for repairing, servicing,even oil refilling)
 * Providing a wide category of options and services with minimal restrictions so as to expose as many helpful facilities as possible
We would also be taking commission from Retailers for using our platform, and managing the payment interface.
