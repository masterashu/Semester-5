# SOAD

## Entire Idea

We aim to provide a all in one market place for local retails for consumers providing them the benefits of shopping. We would allow business to register on our platform and list their services. Consumers can order the products from our website, choosing their choice of merchant or shop. We would also allow Delivery and logistic services to register on our services, which will allow our retail partners to choose from various delivery services, or their existing system as per their need. The users will be able to track their orders and make payment. 

We would take commission from Retailers for using our platform, and managing the payment interface.



## Tech Stack

* Django as a backend Server

  The wide range of libraries available for python as well OS independent development is a big reason to choose Django

* Django REST Framework as a toolkit
  It provides a flexible support to create API endpoints along with regular Django views.
  There are a lot of support libraries for DRF that allows easier support for authentication.

* HTTP Websockets for Notifications and Realtime Updates

  Live updates and notifications would mean a better experience for consumers as well as partners.

* MySQL or PostgreSQL for Database Storage

  Most stable and support multiple platforms

* Swagger for API Documentation

  DRF-swagger allows seamless API Docs generation

* Native Django Support for Frontend using Bootstrap
  Django's built-in Authentication and template system is a really powerful toolkit and would be very useful in creation of our consumer site.
