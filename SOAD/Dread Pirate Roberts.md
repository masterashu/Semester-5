   ### Overview of the project (1 min)

We aim to provide an all in one marketplace for local retailers and consumers providing them the benefits of shopping. We would allow businesses to register on our platform and list their services. Consumers can order the products from our website, choosing their choice of merchant or shop. We would also allow Delivery and logistic methods to register on our site, which will allow our retail partners to choose from various delivery services, or their existing system as per their need. The users will be able to track their orders and make payment. The sellers and logistic services will be able to register and integrate our APIs in their services.
