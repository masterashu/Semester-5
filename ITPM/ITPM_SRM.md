## Q.2 Calculate EMV of projects A and B and determine favorable project

![](a2.png)
$$
EMV(Project\ A) = \Sigma (probability * Outcome)  \\
EMV(Project\ A) = 0.1 * 100,000 + 0.3 * -150,000 + 0.6 * 80,000 = ₹13,000
$$

$$
EMV(Project\ B) = \Sigma (probability * Outcome)  \\
EMV(Project\ B) = 0.25 * 75,000 + 0.1 * -10,000 + 0.65 * 60,000 = ₹56,750
$$

​	Project A is much more favorable than Project B, Since the EMV is less.
