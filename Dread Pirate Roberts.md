### Case Study

Ross Ulbricht (*Dread Pirate Roberts*) created a Tor Hidden site **Silk Road** which was an anonymous marketplace for illegal things.

### Important events and character history

*Lucy Drop* vendor (#1 on Silk Road) account was handled by two partners, *RealLucyDrop* one of them went to jail for sometime due to drug offence, meanwhile his partner took all his assets and scammed a lot of people. His partner also scammed one of the **LSD** suppliers *FriendlyChemist* which blackmailed *D.P.Roberts* saying he has access to vendors personal information as well the buyers personal info and addresses and would release them to public, demanding that *LucyDrop* pays him what he owns.

 *RedAndWhite* was the major supplier of *FriendlyChemist*, after he taked with *D.P.Roberts* he made a deal to execute him and also it was came to light that *FriendlyChemist* was involved in scams with users *Tony76* and more. 

*D.P.Roberts* get more involved with *RedAndWhite* in finding more informations about them.

*RedAndWhite* was himself a scammer who succeeded to scan *D.P.Roberts*.

### How he got caught and he could have avoided it

He created his fake IDs with his real face, which was a really bad move, since it is essential to keep personal information hidden from anything public.

He asked a lot of technical questions related to the bitcoin, etc. using his personal accounts which actually led his discovery by the Investigators in the first place.

He also gave hit orders to an undercover cop.

### What similar things are happening

 There are a lot of similar hidden sites providing anonymity through Bitcoin and Tor, and the security agencies are keep trying to find them. The Dread Pirate Roberts case also revealed a lot of security vulnerabilities that occur in such a business. Which lead other marketplaces become more vigilant and secure and difficult to track.
